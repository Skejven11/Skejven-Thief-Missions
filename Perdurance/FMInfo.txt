* Notes *
Please play on the newest version of NewDark (1.27).
PLEASE keep the fog on (or if for whatever reason it's turned off, please do turn it on), it's very important part of the mission.
Use modern FM loader, for example FMSel, AngelLoader or NewDarkLoader, don't use DarkLoader.

* Briefing *

The Perdurance, a giant ship manufactured by the Mechanists right before the collapse of the order, was meant to travel to Lubeln in Lesser Hrabota and back 
to The City on it's first voyage. Who knew that other cities also had their own underground ancient ruins? At least that's what I expect the Mechanists were there for. 

After setting off on it's return journey back to The City the ship wasn't seen again for nearly a month, yet a few days ago it was sighted near a shore close to 
it's final destination. This steamship, described by my informant as a "roaring beast of metal, staining the sky with gusts of fumes", is supposed to be carrying 
an artifact called the "Mask of Nerlatop". Such a trinket must be of immense value, let's hope it won't bring about another "Metal Age" but rather a small fortune to me. 
I don't expect anyone of the crew to still be there on the ship, yet I can see a small flickering of lights aboard...
